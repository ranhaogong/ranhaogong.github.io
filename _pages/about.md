# :mag_right: About Me {#about-me}

Hi! I am Haoran Gong (公昊苒). I am currently a first-year graduate student at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), 3DSAIL Lab, supervised by [Prof. Di Wang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/diwang). I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, point clouds, and 3D reconstruction.
